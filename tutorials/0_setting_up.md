# Setting up your environment

Disclamer: these steps work on Linux, and usually on OSX. Windows is not yet supported.

1. Open a terminal and navigate to where you want the krom folder to go
2. Run the command `git clone https://github.com/AyoubCoding21/Krom`. This will download the krom source code
3. Move into the krom directory
4. run the command `make`. If you get a _command not found_ error, you may need to install make or g++.
5. If all goes well, after a few seconds you should end up with a krom executable in your current directory called `krom`.
6. Run it with the command `./krom path/to/krom/source.kdev`. If you don't have any krom source code yet, test it with `./krom examples/hello_world.kdev`
7. If it works, you can now move on to the "basic concepts" tutorial
